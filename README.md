Random Functions For Both Work and Play

FizzBuzz.m contains some solutions to the classic, intro to coding, fizzbuzz problem. To those who don't know the problem: Print out the integers from 1-100, when the integer to be printed is a multiple of 3 print a 'Fizz' instead, when the integer is a multiple of 5 print a 'Buzz', and when the integer is a multiple of 3 and 5 print 'FizzBuzz'. Try to solve it before you look! I would also like to add solutions in other languages.

The other scripts in here are dumb little things I've done for fun, along with a project for a CompNeuro class at UW.
